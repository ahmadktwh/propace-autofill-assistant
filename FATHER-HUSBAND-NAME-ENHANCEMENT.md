# Father/Husband Name Field Enhancement

## Overview
Added complete support for extracting and displaying Father/Husband Name field from identity documents to address the missing field extraction issue.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated DEFAULT_FIELDS Array
- Added "Father/Husband Name" as the second field in the DEFAULT_FIELDS array
- Positioned after "Name" field for logical form flow

### 2. Enhanced API Prompt
- Updated Gemini AI API prompt to specifically request "fatherHusbandName" field
- Added comprehensive instructions to look for:
  - "Father's Name" / "Father Name" / "Father"
  - "Husband's Name" / "Husband Name" / "Husband" 
  - "Guardian's Name" / "Guardian" / "Next of Kin"
  - "S/O" (Son of) / "D/O" (Daughter of) / "W/O" (Wife of)
  - Any parental or spousal relationship fields

### 3. Updated Field Validation
- Enhanced `validateAndCleanData()` function fieldMap to include:
  - `fatherHusbandName`: Multiple variations including father_husband_name, fatherName, father_name, husbandName, husband_name, guardianName, guardian_name

### 4. Enhanced Manual Parsing
- Updated `parseResponseManually()` function to include fatherHusbandName field
- Added comprehensive regex pattern to catch various formats:
  - father|father's name|father name
  - husband|husband's name|husband name
  - guardian|guardian's name
  - s/o|d/o|w/o (relationship abbreviations)
  - son of|daughter of|wife of

## Technical Implementation

### JSON Schema Update
```json
{
  "name": "Full name as shown",
  "fatherHusbandName": "Father's name, Husband's name, or Guardian's name if visible",
  "dateOfBirth": "Date in format shown",
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Field Mapping
```javascript
fatherHusbandName: [
  'fatherHusbandName', 
  'father_husband_name', 
  'fatherName', 
  'father_name', 
  'husbandName', 
  'husband_name', 
  'guardianName', 
  'guardian_name'
]
```

### Regex Pattern
```javascript
fatherHusbandName: /(?:father|father's name|father name|husband|husband's name|husband name|guardian|guardian's name|s\/o|d\/o|w\/o|son of|daughter of|wife of)[:\s]*([^\n\r,]+)/i
```

## Expected Results
- Father/Husband Name field will now be extracted from ID cards, passports, and other identity documents
- Field will display in the extraction results with proper formatting
- Copy functionality will work for this field
- Manual fallback parsing will catch the field even if JSON parsing fails

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with various ID document formats containing father/husband names
2. Verify extraction works with different naming conventions (Father's Name, S/O, etc.)
3. Confirm field appears in correct position in results display
4. Test copy functionality for the new field

## Compatibility
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality
- No impact on other field extractions
- UI automatically accommodates the new field through existing responsive design
