========================================
  DEBUGGING STEPS FOR USER
========================================

TO DEBUG THE IMAGE PREVIEW ISSUE:

1. Load your extension in Chrome
2. Right-click on the extension popup → Inspect
3. Go to Console tab
4. Try uploading an image
5. Look for these console messages:

   SHOULD SEE:
   ✓ "Refreshing DOM references..."
   ✓ "DOM refresh results:" (with all elements true)
   ✓ "File input changed [FileList]"
   ✓ "handleFiles: Called with fileList"
   ✓ "showImagePreview: Starting preview for: [filename]"
   ✓ "showImagePreview: All DOM elements found successfully"
   ✓ "showImagePreview: Image loaded successfully!"

   IF YOU SEE ERRORS:
   ✗ "DOM element not found" - HTML structure issue
   ✗ "Failed to load image" - File format issue
   ✗ "No file provided" - Event handling issue

6. Manual DOM inspection commands (paste in console):

   // Check elements exist
   console.log('Elements check:', {
     uploadArea: !!document.getElementById('upload-area'),
     previewArea: !!document.getElementById('image-preview-area'),
     previewImage: !!document.getElementById('preview-image'),
     placeholder: !!document.getElementById('upload-placeholder')
   });

   // Force show preview (test)
   document.getElementById('image-preview-area').hidden = false;
   document.getElementById('image-preview-area').style.display = 'flex';
   document.getElementById('upload-placeholder').hidden = true;

========================================
  CRITICAL FILES MODIFIED
========================================

popup.js:
- refreshDOMReferences() function added
- showImagePreview() completely rewritten with debugging
- handleFiles() enhanced with logging
- Event listeners fixed (no more cloning)

popup.css:
- .preview-image enhanced with !important flags
- .preview-container improved sizing
- .image-preview-area visibility rules

NEXT STEPS:
1. Reload your extension
2. Follow the debugging steps above
3. Share any console error messages you see
4. Try the manual DOM commands to test if it's a visibility issue

The image preview should now work correctly with all these fixes applied.
